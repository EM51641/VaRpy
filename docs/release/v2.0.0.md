# Release Notes â€“ v1.0.0

## ðŸš€ First Major Release: v1.0.0

We are excited to announce the first major release of **VaRpy**, a Python library for Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) modeling using advanced statistical distributions and GARCH models.

---

## What's New

- **Major Refactoring and Modernization**
  - Complete overhaul of the codebase for improved organization, maintainability, and consistency.
  - All VaR models now use a unified, class-based architecture with a shared `BaseVar` interface.
  - Modular design with private helper methods for key computations and clear separation of concerns.

- **Standardized Model Structure**
  - Each model (Normal, Student's t, EVT) follows a consistent interface:
    - Constructor only requires `theta` (confidence level) and `horizon` (forecast period).
    - `.run()` method processes return data and computes VaR/CVaR.
    - Consistent naming and comprehensive docstrings across all classes and methods.

- **Improved Type Hints and Documentation**
  - Extensive use of modern Python type hints (`numpy.typing`) for clarity and static analysis.
  - All methods and classes are fully documented with clear parameter and return type information.

- **Enhanced Code Organization**
  - Models are now located in `varpy/var/models/` with consistent, lower-case file naming.
  - Project configuration and dependencies are managed via `pyproject.toml` (PEP 621), with legacy files (`setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, `requirements.txt`) removed for simplicity.

- **Flexible and Extensible Design**
  - Adding new VaR models is straightforward: inherit from `BaseVar`, implement `run()`, and follow the established modular pattern.
  - Comprehensive contributing guidelines provided in the README.

## Available Models

| Model         | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Normal        | Assumes returns are normally distributed; GARCH(1,1) with Gaussian innovations              |
| Student's t   | Heavy-tailed returns; GARCH(1,1) with Student's t innovations                               |
| EVT           | Extreme Value Theory; combines GARCH with Generalized Pareto Distribution for tail modeling  |
